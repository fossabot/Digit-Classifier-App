Copyright (c) 2019 Ronnie Song

This is a simple Android Digit Classifier that allows its users to drawing a digit, then recognize it using the TFLite File. 

Demo: [here](https://github.com/ronniesong0809/Digit-Classifier-App/releases/tag/v1.0)

Sample code from [tensorflow digit_classifier tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/codelabs/digit_classifier/README.md).


## Goals
 * Create Android interface that takes user input
 * Experience the difference between Java and Kotlin in Android
 * Train models on mnist with Keras in Google Colab and then converting them into TFLIte format
 * Deploy a static TFLite model to Android app
 * Deploy TFLite models dynamically served from *Firebase ML* to Android app
 * Track user feedback to measure model accuracy with *Firebase Analytics*
 * Analyze performance of the model via *Firebase Performance*
 * Select a model via Remote Config via *Firebase Remote Config*
 * Experiment with different models Effectiveness via *Firebase A/B Testing*
